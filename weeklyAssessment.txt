1.output:NullPointerException.



2.Exception:An exception is an event,Which occurs during the execution of a program.
  ExceptionHandling:It is the Mechanism to handle the runtime errors ,So that the normal flow 
  of the application can be maintained.
   Ways we can handle exception:try ,catch,throw,throws and finally.



3.CustomException:
             Java custom exceptions are used to customize the exception according to user need.

  Reason for custom exception:these can store additional information,provide utility methods that can
                               be used to handle or present the exception to a user.



4.Encapsulation:
               The Mechanism of wrapping the data and methods together asa single unit.
   Rules for encapsulation:
                          1)Class shold be public
                          2)variables should be private.
                          3)contain getters and setters
                          4)atleast one Constructor method
                           5)Class should not be final





5)Polymorphism:
             Polymorphsim is the ability of an object to take many forms.
             perform the same action in many different ways.
   Types of polymorhism:
                       1.CompileTimePolymorphism(Method Overloading)
                       2.RuntimePolymorphism(Method Overriding)



6)Overloading: 
            In java, two or more methods may have the same name,If they differ in parameters.
             (different of parameters,different type of parameters)
    Example:class Add{  
	static int add(int a, int b){
	return a+b;
	}  
	static double add(double a, double b){
	return a+b;
	}  
	}  
	class TestOverloading{  
	public static void main(String[] args){  
	System.out.println(Adder.add(9,9));  
	System.out.println(Adder.add(45.9,12.6));  
	}}



7)Overriding:
            if child class has the same method as declared in the parent class,it is known as the method overriding.

   Example:class Human{
   		public void play()
  		 {
   		   System.out.println("Human is playing");
  		 }
		}
		class Boy extends Human{

  	 public void eat(){
     		 System.out.println("Boy is playing");
  	 }
   	public static void main( String args[]) {
   	   Boy obj = new Boy();
    
   	   obj.play();
   	}
	}

11)Abstraction:
           The process of exposing all the necessary details and hiding the rest.
       We can achieve abstraction in two ways:
                                             1.Using Abstract Class
                                             2.Using Interface

      Using Interface We achieve 100% abstraction.



12)two types:Static and instance initializers
